Compare the performances of traditional methods and distribution-uncertain methods
The first part of the codes display kinds of popular methods dealing with 
imbalanced learning; 
The second part focus on the mean-uncertain method, and select the optimal upper mean by 5-fold cross-validation analysis; 
Thirdly, the codes run for the volatility-uncertain method,  and select the optimal upper volatility and lower volatility by 5-fold cross-validation analysis;
Finally, we display the performances on testing set 
For detailed result of 5-fold cross-validation analysis, see dictionary "parameter_selection", and see "parameter_selection.txt" for specification.
