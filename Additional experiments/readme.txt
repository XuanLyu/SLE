We present the process of evaluating different models in this folder:

1.The results of Simulation study is reported in ``Simulation study on dsitribution-uncertain...''

2. The comparisons of distribution-uncertain methods and SOTA methods in terms of time-cost and accuracy are presented in ``comparisons of training time...''. These comparisons are conducted on three CelebA datasets.

3.  The comprehensive comparisons of distribution-uncertain methods and all of the SOTA methods can be found in other ``.ipnb'' files, each of which corresponds to a dataset.

To make it more clear, we have packaged the related codes of ``Mean-uncertain method'' and ``Volatility-uncertain method'' in folder ``Distribution-uncertain methods''.


Finally, all codes can be run in jupyter.
